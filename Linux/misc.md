Misc Stuff

Various commands that I might use a few flags on but I'm not 100% with yet.

Wget to Avoid Clicking Image Links
----------------------------------
* Works with Startpage, SearX instances, and DuckDuckGo  
* Does NOT work with Google, Bing, or Yahoo  

If you're on a search engine, and you find an image link, you can copy the link and paste it in your terminal with:


```
wget http://res.cloudinary.com/sagacity/image/upload/c_crop,h_451,w_590,x_0,y_0/c_limit,w_1080/v1434574372/Screen_Shot_2015-06-17_at_1.52.19_PM_ltahyz.png
```

and the image should download into the directory that you ran the command in.
