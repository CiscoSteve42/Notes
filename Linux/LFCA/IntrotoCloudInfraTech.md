Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies
=================================================

Virtualization
--------------
* **Cloud Computing** is a computing model that enables remote allocation of computing resources, owned by a third party, to be utilized by end users

* The definition according to the **NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology)** is "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort service provider interaction"

* Most cloud service models fall into one of the following NIST categories:

    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

    * **SaaS (Sofware as a Service)**

* Additional service models introduced to describe the needs and requirements of clients of remote computing services:

    * **Analytics as a Service (AnaaS)**

    * **API as a Service (AaaS)**

    * **Big Data as a Service (BDaaS)**

    * **Business Process as a Service (BPaaS)**

    * **Code as a Service (CaaS)**

    * **Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS)**

    * **Desktop as a Service (DaaS)**

    * **Database as a Service (DBaaS)**

    * **Function as a Service (FaaS)**

    * **Monitoring as a Service (MaaS)**

    * **Anything as a Service (XaaS)**

    * **Deez Nuts as a Service (DNaaS)**


### Key Features of Cloud computing

* **Speed and Agility**

* **Cost**

* **Easy Access to Resources**

* **Maintenance**

* **Multi-tenancy**

* **Reliability**

* **Scalability and Elasticity**

* **Security**


### Cloud Deployment Models

* **Private Cloud** designated and operated soley for one organization, can be built using a software stack such as OpenStack

* **Public Cloud** AWS, GCP, Azure. Cloud for anybody that will pay

* **Hybrid Cloud** combination of public and private cloud, beneficial for storing sensitive information on the private cloud and meeting temporary resource needs during peak or times of high demand by cloud scaling (known as **Bursting**)

* **Community Cloud** multiple organizations sharing a common cloud Infrastructure

* **Distributed Cloud** formed by distributed systems connected to a single network

* **Multicloud** organization using multiple cloud vendors for it's workload, usually to avoid vendor lock-in

* **Poly Cloud** one organization uses multiple public cloud providers to leverage specific services from each provider


### Virtualization

* **Examples of Type-1 Hypervisors:**

    * **Proxmox** They didn't ACTUALLY put it on this list, but less people are sleeping on it everyday

    * **AWS Nitro**

    * **Microsoft Hyper-V**

    * **Nutanix AHV**

    * **Oracle VM Server for SPARC**

    * **Oracle VM Server for x86**

    * **Red Hat Virtualization**

    * **VMWare ESXi**

    * **Xen**

* **Type-2 Hypervisors:**

    * **Parallels Desktop for Mac**

    * **VirtualBox**

    * **VMware Player**

    * **VMWare Workstation**

* **Linux Kernel Modules that Fit Both Categories:**

    * KVM

    * bhyve

* **Software Emulation** occurs at both the system and user space levels, as supported by a tool such as QEMU, allows for any OS to run on any architecture, or for programs to run on originally unsupported systems. Can be used in conjunction with hypervisors such as KVM to provision VMs


### KVM Overview

* [Mental Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/MentalOutlaw) has a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxxP39cNJOs) on getting KVM set up with QUEMU/virt-manager.

* **KVM** is a loadable virtualization module of the Linux kernel that converts the kernel into a hypervisor capable of managing guest VMs. Originally designed for x86, but ported to FreeBSD(umm what? this is listed but it's an OS, not a CPU architecture...maybe they know something I don't? Whatever.), S/390, PowerPC, IA-64, and ARM
