Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies
=================================================

Virtualization
--------------
* **Cloud Computing** is a computing model that enables remote allocation of computing resources, owned by a third party, to be utilized by end users

* The definition according to the **NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology)** is "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort service provider interaction"

* Most cloud service models fall into one of the following NIST categories:

    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

    * **SaaS (Sofware as a Service)**

* Additional service models introduced to describe the needs and requirements of clients of remote computing services:

    * **Analytics as a Service (AnaaS)**

    * **API as a Service (AaaS)**

    * **Big Data as a Service (BDaaS)**

    * **Business Process as a Service (BPaaS)**

    * **Code as a Service (CaaS)**

    * **Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS)**

    * **Desktop as a Service (DaaS)**

    * **Database as a Service (DBaaS)**

    * **Function as a Service (FaaS)**

    * **Monitoring as a Service (MaaS)**

    * **Anything as a Service (XaaS)**

    * **Deez Nuts as a Service (DNaaS)**


### Key Features of Cloud computing

* **Speed and Agility**

* **Cost**

* **Easy Access to Resources**

* **Maintenance**

* **Multi-tenancy**

* **Reliability**

* **Scalability and Elasticity**

* **Security**


### Cloud Deployment Models

* **Private Cloud** designated and operated soley for one organization, can be built using a software stack such as OpenStack

* **Public Cloud** AWS, GCP, Azure. Cloud for anybody that will pay

* **Hybrid Cloud** Cloud fusion

* **Community Cloud**

* **Distributed Cloud**

* **Multicloud**

* **Poly Cloud**
