Vim Cheatsheet
--------------
Various things that I pick up to make my Vim/NeoVim experiece (even more) pleasant  

f, F, t, and T:
--------------
fQ would go to Q in the following line:
```
print('Then Picard exclaimed "Q!!!!!!!!"')
```
tQ would take you to the quotation mark right before it. 

FQ and TQ do the same thing but backwards.
