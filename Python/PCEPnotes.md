stuff that I should know but I need to review

Mutable vs Immutable Variables
------------------------------
### Immutable

* "Something that cannot be changed or altered"


* Types of Immutable Variables
    * ints `x = 69`
    * floats `x = 2.5`
    * strings `x = 'yes'`
    * tuples `x = (420, 'yolo', 'swag')`
