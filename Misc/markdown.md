Markdown and Neovim  
===================  
Working towards a brighter future with less useless commits.  

Headers  
-------  

* 1st Header  =  below line  
* 2nd Header  -  below line   
* 3rd Header  ### before line   

Code Blocks
-----------

- Backticks (\`) are used for code snippets like this `x = 69`    
    - Use the Backslash (\) to use without making a snippet  

- Triple Backticks (````) 'fence' around your code on the line above and below like this:  

\`\`\`  
#!/usr/bin/env python3  

name = input('What is your name?')  
\`\`\`
