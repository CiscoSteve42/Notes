Android 13 w/ Termux Notes
==========================
* Documenting me cloning my Notes repo and setting up Git and my Github stuff in Termux on my Android 13 phone. I am not rooted this is just stock Android but Termux still has some cool stuff to offer besides being able to read manpages on your phone and telling people that you're running Tmux in Termux.

* I'm planning to only work on this file from my phone (which is painfully slower than my regular pace) and setting up a workable environment on my phone, which I imagine will be pretty alias heavy. I definitely plan on covering proot-distro at some point, not sure what else yet just a fun little side project for those rare moments that I don't have my laptop.
